Date Knight is a fun and easy-to-use website that helps you plan the perfect meal to enjoy while watching your favorite movie or TV show. Simply search for a show using the search bar or choose from a curated list. Once you select a title, a delicious meal suggestion will appear!

Click on any show to view more details-recommended meal pairings will be displayed on the right. Select a meal to see its full recipe, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions.

No downloads or installation required-just browse, choose, and cook!
